You are extracting data from a DENTAL TREATMENT RECORD form
The form contains a table of treatment entries.
Each row represents one treatment record.

Extraction Rules:
-Extract each row as a separate object
-Preserve text exactly as written
-If a cell is blank or unreadable, set its value to null
-Dates must be returned as ISO strings (YYYY-MM-DD) if readable
-Amount fields must be numbers only (no currency symbols)
-If a row is completely empty, ignore it

Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:
{
  treatmentRecord:[
    {
    "date": string | null,
    "toothQuantity": string | null,
    "procedure": string | null,
    "dentist": string | null,
